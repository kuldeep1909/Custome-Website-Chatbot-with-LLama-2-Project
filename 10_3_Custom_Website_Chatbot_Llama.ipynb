From the inception of simple rule-based systems to the modern era of complex neural networks and deep learning, AI has transformed from an abstract concept into a pervasive and influential force across various domains.\\n\\nLlama 2 operates by leveraging a vast dataset of 2 trillion \"tokens\" drawn from publicly accessible sources, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia, and public domain books from Project Gutenberg. Each token represents a word or semantic fragment that enables the model to comprehend text and predict subsequent content plausibly. This enables Llama 2 to discern relationships between concepts, like understanding that \"Apple\" and \"iPhone\" are closely related but distinct from \"apple,\" \"banana,\" and \"fruit.\"\\n\\nTo ensure responsible usage, the developers employed various training strategies, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), to refine the model for safety and appropriateness. Human testers ranked different responses to guide the model toward generating more suitable outputs. Chat versions were further fine-tuned with specific data to enhance their ability to engage in natural dialogues.\\n\\nThese models serve as a foundation for customization. Organizations can train Llama 2 with their particular brand style or voice to generate article summaries or improve customer support responses by providing it with relevant information like FAQs and chat logs.\\n\\nHow does llama 2 work?? 🤔\\n\\nLlama 2\\'s functioning involves training its neural network with an extensive dataset of 2 trillion \"tokens\" sourced from publicly available materials such as Common Crawl, Wikipedia, and public domain books from Project Gutenberg. Each token, representing a word or semantic fragment, enables the model to comprehend text, anticipate subsequent content, and establish connections between related concepts like \"Apple\" and \"iPhone,\" distinguishing them from \"apple,\" \"banana,\" and \"fruit.\"\\n\\nRecognizing the potential pitfalls of training an AI model on the open internet, the developers employed additional techniques, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), to refine the model\\'s capacity for producing safe and constructive responses. Human testers played a role in ranking different AI model responses to guide it toward generating more appropriate outputs. Moreover, the chat versions underwent fine-tuning using specific data to enhance their ability to engage in natural conversations.\\n\\nLlama-2 Chat’s instruction-tuned version clearly surpasses ChatGPT and other open-source models by a significant margin, ranging from 60% to 75%. This is a major development in the realm of open innovation.\\n\\nPre-Training:\\n\\nThe model is trained on a vast dataset of 2 trillion tokens, using a bytepair encoding (BPE) algorithm for tokenization. It employs the standard transformer architecture, pre-normalization with RMSNorm, the SwiGLU activation function, and rotary positional embedding. Notably, it offers an increased context length.In terms of hyperparameters, the model uses the AdamW optimizer, incorporates a cosine learning rate schedule with a warm-up period of 2000 steps, and decays the final learning rate to 10% of the peak learning rate. It applies a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping. The model exhibits strong performance across various tasks, including coding, Q&A in context, commonsense reasoning, and knowledge benchmarks.\\n\\nFine-Tuning:\\n\\nThe approach to fine-tuning is depicted in the architecture diagram above, consisting of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) components.\\n\\nSFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning):\\n\\nIn this phase, Meta introduces an innovative approach by categorizing data into prompts related to helpfulness and safety. The process commenced with the utilization of publicly available instruction tuning data (Chung et al., 2022), meticulously annotating around 27,540 instances with a strong focus on data quality. During supervised fine-tuning, a cosine learning rate schedule was employed, starting with an initial learning rate of 2*10–5. The process involved a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens. These hyperparameters underwent fine-tuning over a span of 2 epochs. The training objective followed an auto-regressive approach, where the loss on tokens from the user prompt was zeroed out, and back-propagation was exclusively applied to answer tokens.\\n\\nRLHF :\\n\\nMeta established a precise procedure for annotators during the data collection process. Initially, annotators created a prompt, following which they were presented with two responses generated by the model. Their task was to evaluate these responses based on predefined criteria. To enhance diversity, the two responses for each prompt were drawn from two different model variants, each employing distinct temperature hyper-parameters. As previously illustrated, the data collected was classified according to safety and helpfulness dimensions, forming the foundation for the Reward Model.\\n\\nMeta developed multiple iterations of RLHF, spanning from V1 to V5, utilizing an Instructed Fine-Tuning (IFT) approach supported by two distinct algorithms:\\n\\n1. Proximal Policy\\n\\nOptimization (PPO): This method aligns with OpenAI’s approach, employing the reward model as an estimate for the genuine reward function, which reflects human preferences. The pre-trained language model serves as the policy, subject to optimization.\\n\\n2. Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning: This approach involves sampling K outputs from the model and selecting the most promising candidate based on a reward score. The chosen outputs form a new gold standard for further model fine-tuning. This process reinforces the reward mechanism, iteratively enhancing model performance.\\n\\nThe Rejection Sampling approach used on the 70B model is seen as intuitive and easier to understand for learning purposes. It helps maintain a growing gap between the median and maximum performance, indicating overall progress.\\n\\nMeta trained two distinct reward models, Safety reward model (R_s) and Helpfulness reward model (R_h). To prioritize safety, prompts with potential for unsafe responses were identified, and responses were filtered using a threshold of 0.15, resulting in a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.55 based on evaluation with the Meta Safety test set.\\n\\nThe training process employed the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping at 1.0. A constant learning rate of 10*-6 was used during training. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) iterations used a batch size of 512, a PPO clip threshold of 0.2, and a mini-batch size of 64, with one gradient step per mini-batch.\\n\\nG Host Attention(GAtt) :\\n\\nThe issue of context loss in multi-turn conversations has been acknowledged and addressed by Meta through the implementation of the GAtt (GHost Attention) method. This method involved artificially concatenating instructions to all user messages in the conversation. Subsequently, Meta used the latest RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) model to sample from this augmented dataset. This process resulted in the acquisition of context-rich dialogues and corresponding samples, which were employed for fine-tuning the model, somewhat similar to the concept of Rejection Sampling. The overall outcome demonstrated enhanced attention compared to the existing model. It’s worth noting that this approach was specifically evaluated on 70B models.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThese models serve as a foundation for customization. Users can train Llama 2 to create article summaries in their company\\'s unique style or voice by providing it with numerous examples. Similarly, they can further enhance chat-optimized models to better respond to customer support requests by providing relevant information like FAQs and chat logs.\\n\\nMany well-known Language Model Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI\\'s GPT-3 and GPT-4, Google\\'s PaLM and PaLM 2, and Anthropic\\'s Claude, are typically closed source. While researchers and businesses can access these models through official APIs and fine-tune them for specific responses, they lack transparency about the model\\'s inner workings.\\n\\nHowever, Llama 2 stands out by offering openness. Interested individuals can access a detailed research paper explaining how the model was created and trained. They can download the model and, with the necessary technical expertise, run it on their computers or delve into its code, although it\\'s important to note that even the smallest version requires over 13 GB of storage.\\n\\nFurthermore, users can deploy Llama 2 on cloud infrastructures like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services via platforms such as Hugging Face. This enables them to train the model on their own data to generate tailored text. It\\'s essential to follow Meta\\'s guidelines for responsible use when working with Llama.\\n\\nMeta\\'s open approach with Llama fosters greater control for companies looking to develop AI-powered applications. The primary restriction is that companies with over 700 million monthly users must seek special permission to use Llama, making it unavailable to tech giants like Apple, Google, and Amazon.\\n\\nThis openness in AI development is significant as it aligns with the historical trend of advancements in computing built upon open research and experimentation. While companies like Google and OpenAI will remain key players in the field, the release of Llama ensures the existence of credible alternatives to closed-source AI systems, reducing the potential for monopolies and promoting innovation.\\n\\nMeta AI\\'s inaugural version of the Large Language Model, LLaMA 1, was introduced in February of this year. It represents a remarkable assembly of foundational models, encompassing models with parameters spanning from 7 billion to 65 billion.\\n\\nWhat sets LLaMA 1 apart is its remarkable training on trillions of tokens, demonstrating that achieving state-of-the-art language models is possible solely through publicly available datasets, without relying on proprietary or inaccessible data sources.\\n\\nRemarkably, the LLaMA-13B model has outperformed ChatGPT, despite having a significantly smaller parameter size of 13 billion compared to ChatGPT\\'s 175 billion, across most benchmark datasets. This achievement underscores LLaMA\\'s efficiency in achieving top-tier performance with a considerably reduced number of parameters.\\n\\nEven the largest model in the LLaMA collection, LLaMA-65B, holds its own against other prominent models in the field of natural language processing (NLP), such as Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\n\\nLLaMA\\'s distinguishing feature lies in its strong commitment to openness and accessibility. Meta AI, the creators of LLaMA, have demonstrated their dedication to advancing the AI field through collaborative efforts by making all their models available to the research community. This approach notably differs from OpenAI\\'s GPT-3 and GPT-4.\\n\\nLlama 2-Chat is a specialized variant of Llama 2 tailored for dialogue-oriented applications. It has undergone fine-tuning to enhance its performance, ensuring it provides more contextually relevant responses during conversations.\\n\\nWhile Llama 2 was initially pretrained using openly accessible online data sources, Llama 2-Chat has been fine-tuned using publicly available instruction datasets and incorporates over 1 million human annotations to refine its dialogue capabilities.\\n\\nMeta’s researchers have introduced multiple versions of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat with diverse parameter sizes, including 7 billion, 13 billion, and 70 billion. These options are designed to accommodate a range of computational needs and application scenarios, empowering researchers and developers to select the most appropriate model for their specific tasks. This accessibility enables startups to leverage Llama 2 models for developing their machine learning products, encompassing various generative AI applications and AI chatbots similar to Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\n\\nLarge Language Models\\n\\nNaturallanguageprocessing\\n\\nMachine Learning\\n\\nOpen Source\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\nWritten by Pratik\\n\\n31 Followers\\n\\n747 Following\\n\\nMy interest:- Fundamentals of: AGI, Quantum_Computing, Longevity, Brain_Computer_Interface.

From that period on, many Generative Models have come into the picture. With each release of new Generative Large Language Models, AI kept on coming closer to Human Intelligence. However, the Open AI community made the GPT family of powerful Large Language Models closed source. Fortunately, Falcon AI, a highly capable Generative Model, surpassing many other LLMs, and it is now open source, available for anyone to use. Falcon AI integrates cutting-edge machine learning techniques, offering users unprecedented capabilities in generating natural language text.\\n\\nLearning Objectives\\n\\nTo understand why Falcon AI topped the LLM Leaderboard\\n\\nTo learn the capabilities of Falcon AI\\n\\nObserving the Falcon AI Performance\\n\\nSetting up Falcon AI in Python\\n\\nTesting Falcon AI in LangChain with custom Prompts\\n\\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\\n\\nTable of contents\\n\\nFirst Look: Falcon Large Language Model\\n\\nDownload the Packages\\n\\nImport Libraries\\n\\nSteps Involved in Testing Falcon 7B\\n\\nFalcon AI with LangChain\\n\\nInstall LangChain Package\\n\\nIncorporating API\\n\\nSteps Involved\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nWhat is Falcon AI?\\n\\nFalcon AI, mainly Falcon LLM 40B, is a Large Language Model released by the UAE’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII). The 40B indicates the 40 Billion parameters used by this Large Language Model uses. The TII has even developed a 7B, i.e., 7 billion parameters model that’s trained on 1500 billion tokens. In comparison, the Falcon LLM 40B model is trained on 1 trillion tokens of RefinedWeb. What makes this LLM different from others is that this model is transparent and Open Source.\\n\\nThe Falcon, an autoregressive decoder-only model, represents a significant advancement in AI models. Its development involved rigorous training on the AWS Cloud for a continuous period of two months, utilizing 384 GPUs. The pretraining data predominantly comprised publicly available sources, supplemented by select data extracted from research papers and discussions on social media platforms.\\n\\nWhy Falcon AI?\\n\\nLarge Language Models are profoundly influenced by the data they’re trained on, and their responsiveness fluctuates with evolving datasets. For Falcon, we meticulously curated the training data, drawing from a diverse array of sources including extracts from high-quality websites (RefinedWeb Dataset). Through meticulous filtering and de-duplication processes, we ensured the integrity and richness of the dataset, setting a solid foundation for Falcon’s training. In addition to utilizing readily available data sources, we tailored the dataset to suit Falcon’s architecture, optimizing it for inference tasks. As a result, Falcon exhibits superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models such as Google, Anthropic, Deepmind, LLaMa, and others, as evidenced by its top ranking on the OpenLLM Leaderboard. This demonstrates Falcon’s prowess in handling diverse AI models and datasets.\\n\\nApart from all this, the main differentiator is that it’s open-sourced, thus allowing for commercial use with no restrictions. So anyone can finetune Falcon with their data to create their application from this Large Language Model. Falcon even offers specialized versions known as Falcon-7B-Instruct and Falcon-40B-Instruct, pre-trained on conversational data. You can seamlessly integrate these models to develop chat applications tailored to specific needs, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence.\\n\\nFirst Look: Falcon Large Language Model\\n\\nIn this section, we will be exploring one of Falcon’s models, and the variant we’ll delve into is the Falcon-40B Model, known for its remarkable performance on the OpenLLM Leaderboard charts. However, let’s not overlook the Falcon 180B, a model that also holds its own in various contexts.\\n\\nFor our demonstration, we’ll focus on the Falcon-40B-Instruct version, meticulously fine-tuned on conversational data to ensure seamless interaction. To engage with the Falcon Instruct model, one convenient avenue is through HuggingFace Spaces. Notably, HuggingFace offers a dedicated Space for the Falcon-40B-Instruct Model, aptly named the Falcon-Chat demo.\\n\\nClick here to explore the site and experience its capabilities firsthand.\\n\\nAfter opening the site, scroll down to see the chat section, which is similar to the pic above. In the “Type an input and press Enter” field, enter the query you want to ask the Falcon Model and press Enter to start the conversation. Let’s ask a question to the Falcon Model and see its output.\\n\\nIn Image 1, we can see the response generated. That was a good response from the Falcon-40B model to the query. We have seen the working of Falcon-40B-Instruct in the HuggingFace Spaces. But what if we want to work with it in a specific code? We can do this by using the Transformers library. We will go through the necessary steps now.\\n\\nDownload the Packages\\n\\n!pip install transformers accelerate einops xformers\\n\\nWe install the transformers package to download and work with the state-of-the-art models that are pre-train, like the Falcon. The accelerate package enables us to run PyTorch models on whichever system we are working with, and currently, we are using Google Colab. The einops and xformers are the other packages that support the Falcon model.\\n\\nImport Libraries\\n\\nNow we need to import these libraries to download and start working with the Falcon model. The code will be:\\n\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\\nimport transformers\\nimport torch\\n\\n\\nmodel = \"tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\"\\n\\n\\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)\\n\\n\\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\\n    \"text-generation\",\\n    model=model,\\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\\n    trust_remote_code=True,\\n    device_map=\"auto\",\\n    max_length=200,\\n    do_sample=True,\\n    top_k=10,\\n    num_return_sequences=1,\\n    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id\\n)\\n\\nSteps Involved in Testing Falcon 7B\\n\\nFirstly, we need to provide the path to the model that we will be testing. Here we will be working with the Falcon-7B-Instruct model because it takes less space in GPU and can be can with the free tier in the Google Colab.\\n\\nThe Falcon-7B-Instruct Large Language Model link is stored in the model variable.\\n\\nTo download the tokenizer for this model, we write the from_pretrained() method from the AutoTokenizer class present in transformers.\\n\\nTo this, we provide the LLM path, which then downloads the Tokenizer that works for this model.\\n\\nNow we create a pipeline. When creating the pipelines, we provide the necessary options, like the model we are working with and the type of model, i.e., “text-generation” for our use case.\\n\\nThe type of tokenizer and other parameters are provided to the pipeline object.\\n\\nLet’s try observing Falcon’s 7B instruct model output by providing the model with a query. To test the Falcon model, we will write the below code.\\n\\nsequences = pipeline(\\n   \"Create a list of 3 important things to reduce global warming\"\\n)\\n\\n\\nfor seq in sequences:\\n    print(f\"Result: {seq[\\'generated_text\\']}\")\\n    \\n\\nWe asked the Falcon Large Language Model to list the three important things to reduce global warming. Let’s see the output generated by this model.\\n\\nWe can see that the Falcon 7B Instruct model has produced a good result. It pointed out the root problems for the cause of global warming and even provided the appropriate solution for tackling the issues, thus reducing global warming.\\n\\nFalcon AI with LangChain\\n\\nLangchain is a Python Library designed to facilitate the development of applications leveraging Large Language Models. One of its notable features is the HuggingFacePipeline, tailored for models hosted within the HuggingFace ecosystem. With this capability, integrating Falcon with LangChain becomes a feasible option, enabling seamless utilization of AI models in your applications.\\n\\nInstall LangChain Package\\n\\n!pip install langchain\\n\\nThis will download the latest langchain package. Now, we need to create a Pipeline for the Falcon model, which we will do so by:\\n\\nfrom langchain import HuggingFacePipeline\\n\\n\\nllm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline = pipeline, model_kwargs = {\\'temperature\\':0})\\n\\nWe call the HuggingFacePipeline() object and pass the pipeline and the model parameters.\\n\\nHere we are using the pipeline from the “First Look: Falcon Large Language Model” section.\\n\\nFor the model parameters, we are providing the temperature a value of 0, which makes the model not hallucinate much(creating its own answers).\\n\\nAll this, we pass to a variable called llm, which stores our Large Language Model.\\n\\nIncorporating API\\n\\nNow we know that LangChain contains PromptTemplate, which allows us to alter the answers produced by the Large Language Model. Additionally, we have LLMChain, which seamlessly integrates the PromptTemplate and the LLM together. Let’s write code utilizing these methods, incorporating an API for enhanced functionality.\\n\\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate,  LLMChain\\n\\ntemplate = \"\"\"\\nYou are a intelligent chatbot. You reply should be in a funny way.\\nQuestion: {query}\\nAnswer:\"\"\"\\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[\"query\"])\\n\\n\\nllm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)\\n\\nSteps Involved\\n\\nFirstly, we define a template for the Prompt. The template describes how our LLM should behave, that is, how it should answer the questions given by the user.\\n\\nThis is then passed to the PromptTemplate() method and stored in a variable\\n\\nNow we need to chain the Large Language Model and the Prompt together, which we do so by providing them to the LLMChain() method.\\n\\nNow our model is ready. According to the Prompt, the model must funnily answer a given question. Let’s try this with an example code.\\n\\nquery = \"How to reach the moon?\"\\n\\n\\nprint(llm_chain.run(query))\\n\\nSo we gave the query “How to reach the moon?” to the model. The answer is below:\\n\\nThe response generated by the Falcon-7B-Instruct model is indeed funny. It followed the prompt given by us and generated the appropriate answer to the given question. This is just one of the few things we can discover with this new Open Source Model.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we have discussed a new Large Language Model called Falcon. Falcon AI has taken the top spot on the OpenLLM Leaderboard by beating top models like Llama, MPT, StableLM, and many more. The best thing about this Model is that it’s Open Source, meaning that anyone can develop applications with Falcon AI for commercial purposes.\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nFalcon-40B is right now, positioned at the top of the OpenLLM Leaderboard\\n\\nFlacon has open-sourced both the 40 Billion and the 7 Billion models\\n\\nYou can work with the Instruct models of Falcon, which are pre-trained on conversations, to quickly get started.\\n\\nOptimise Falcon’s architecture for Inference.\\n\\nFinetune this model to build different applications.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nQ1.

Since its founding in 2001, the company has made numerous advancements in rocket propulsion, reusable launch vehicle, human spaceflight and satellite constellation technology. As of 2024[update], SpaceX is the world\\'s dominant space launch provider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like the Chinese space program.[8] SpaceX, NASA, and the United States Armed Forces work closely together by means of governmental contracts.[9]\\n\\nSpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2001 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way to a sustainable colony on Mars. In 2008, when SpaceX was almost bankrupt, Falcon 1 successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then pivoted towards the development of the larger Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon 1 capsule to satisfy NASA\\'s COTS contracts for deliveries to the International Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began delivering Commercial Resupply Services missions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make the Falcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated the first successful first-stage landing in 2015 and re-launch of the first stage in 2017. Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters, first flew in 2018 after a more than decade-long development process. As of October 2024, the company\\'s Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown again more than 330 times, reaching 1–2 launches a week.\\n\\nThese milestones delivered the company much-needed investment and SpaceX sought to diversify its sources of income. In 2019, the first operational satellite of the Starlink internet satellite constellation came online. In subsequent years, Starlink generated the bulk of SpaceX\\'s income and paved the way for its Starshield military counterpart. In 2020, SpaceX began to operate its Dragon 2 capsules to deliver crewed missions for NASA and private entities. Around this time, SpaceX began building test prototypes for Starship, which is the largest launch vehicle in history and aims to fully realize the company\\'s vision of a fully-reusable, cost-effective and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its own space suit and astronaut via its Polaris program[10] as well as developing the human lander for lunar missions under NASA\\'s Artemis program.[11] SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a revenue of over $10 billion in 2024.[12]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: History of SpaceX\\n\\nSee also: List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches\\n\\n2001–2004: Founding\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated $100,000 to his Mars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time.[13]: 30–31 He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[14][15] Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr launch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.[16]\\n\\nMusk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringing Michael Griffin, who later became the 11th Administrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[17][18] On the flight home, Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[18] By applying vertical integration,[17] using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components when possible,[18] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch costs.[18]\\n\\nIn early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined the position of Chief Engineer,[19]: 11 Jim Cantrell and John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey would later found the company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[19][20] SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[21] Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX\\'s early employees.[19]: 22\\n\\nMusk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[22]\\n\\n2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Falcon 1\\n\\nSpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal funding.[23][24] The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately $90 million[25] to $100 million.[19]: 215\\n\\nThe Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars\\'s Millennium Falcon fictional spacecraft.[26]\\n\\nIn 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS program.[19]: 109–110 [27] In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[28] In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396 million to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under the COTS program.[29]\\n\\nThe first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under the DARPA Falcon Project which evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile delivery for Prompt Global Strike.[24][30][31] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well,[32] and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time.[19]: 178–182 Musk was reportedly \"waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain\" because of the stress.[19]: 216\\n\\nThe financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth attempt on 28 September 2008. Musk split his remaining $30 million between SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract awarding $1.6 billion to SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.[19]: 217–221 Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[33] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at the time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with the NASA Associate Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier.[34][19]: 222\\n\\n2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.[35] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.[36] The overall contract award was $278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[36] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.\\n\\nThe first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9\\'s second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[37] By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.[38]\\n\\nIn April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a $75 million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[39] NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.[40]\\n\\nIn early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[41] and his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth $875 million on private markets,[42] valuing SpaceX at $1.3 billion.[43] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.[44] After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4 billion or $20/share.[45][46] By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately $200 million, with Musk investing approximately $100 million and other investors having put in about $100 million.[47]\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.[48] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[48]\\n\\n2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[49] That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.[50][51] Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA).[52] The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over $400 million over the years.[53] In September 2014, NASA\\'s Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification.[40]\\n\\nIn January 2015, SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion.[54] The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites.[55]\\n\\nThe Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that held a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[56]\\n\\n2015–2017: Reusability milestones\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20.[57] In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean.[58] By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.[59]\\n\\nA second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The payload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at $200 million, was destroyed.[60] The explosion was caused by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.[61] Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[62]\\n\\nIn March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[63] The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[64]\\n\\n2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn July 2017, the company raised $350 million, which raised its valuation to $21 billion.[65] In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[66] By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12 billion in contract revenue.[67] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[68] This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[69]\\n\\nIn 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[70] and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees,[71] which was completed in May 2018,[72] and opened to the public in December 2018.[73] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.[73]\\n\\nSince 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2019 SpaceX raised $1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds.[74] By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3 billion[75] and reached $36 billion by March 2020.[76]\\n\\nOn 19 August 2020, after a $1.9 billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX\\'s valuation increased to $46 billion.[77][78][79]\\n\\nIn February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional $1.61 billion in an equity round from 99 investors[80] at a per share value of approximately $420,[79] raising the company valuation to approximately $74 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than $6 billion in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[80] By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $100.3 billion.[81] On 16 April 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical role in the NASA crewed spaceflight Artemis program.[82] By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking services for Starlink.[83] A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at $127 billion.[84]\\n\\nIn July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster from CRS-23 on it for the first time on 29 August 2021.[85] Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On 13 December 2021, company CEO Elon Musk announced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured carbon into rocket fuel,[86][87] after he announced a $100 million donation to the X Prize Foundation the previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon capture technology.[88][89]\\n\\nIn August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company\\'s launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[90] Since that invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.[91]\\n\\nIn 2022, SpaceX\\'s Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year.[92][93][non-primary source needed] SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[92]\\n\\nIn November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplier Pioneer Aerospace out of bankruptcy for $2.2 million.[94][95]\\n\\n2024 headquarters move from California to Texas\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: SAFETY Act (California law) § Elon Musk\\n\\nOn 16 July 2024, Elon Musk posted on X that SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne, California, to SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed California AB1955 bill \"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies\".[96] This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes to a student\\'s sexual orientation and gender identity.[97] The headquarters officially moved to Brownsville, Texas in August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.[98]\\n\\nThe move to relocate SpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The Hawthorne facility continues to support the company\\'s Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX\\'s workhorse product in 2024.\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s Polaris Dawn mission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major milestone in commercial space exploration.[99]\\n\\nStarship\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.[100] The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.[101] SpaceX\\'s Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a payload capacity of 100+ tons.[102][103] Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.\\n\\nOn 20 April 2023, Starship\\'s first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico before booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reach max q later than planned. \"Max q\" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success.[104][105]\\n\\nMusk said at the time that it would take \"six to eight weeks\" to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project\\'s progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon.[106][107]\\n\\nOn 18 November 2023, SpaceX launched its second integrated Starship test, with both vehicles flying for a few minutes before separately exploding.[108][109][110][111]\\n\\nIn early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting 14 March as the tentative launch date for its next uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a \"launch license\" by the FAA. This license was granted on 13 March 2024.[112] On 14 March 2024 at 13:25 UTC, Starship launched for the 3rd time and for the first time Starship reached its planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being lost during reentry over the Indian Ocean.[102][103]\\n\\nOn 4 June 2024, SpaceX received the launch license for Starship\\'s 4th test flight. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first time that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch subsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that they met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of hardware. The provision could prove to speed the development timeline.[113]\\n\\nOn 12 October 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval for Starship\\'s 5th test flight.[114]\\n\\nSpaceX launched Starship on its 6th test flight on 19 November 2024.[115]\\n\\nCrewed launches\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nA significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.[116][117] The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) in Florida.[118]\\n\\nStarlink\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world\\'s largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[119] In 2022, most SpaceX launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit.[120]\\n\\nOn 16 July 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company building a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices, for $524 million.[121][4]\\n\\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the launch up to 7,500 of SpaceX\\'s next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[122]\\n\\nSummary of achievements\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDate Achievement Flight 28 September 2008 First privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.

The small-lift Falcon 1 was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-lift Falcon 9 and the heavy-lift Falcon Heavy are both operational.\\n\\nFalcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which two were successful.[144] The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[123]\\n\\nFalcon 9 is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to orbit, competing with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage. The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012 and launched the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[44] The vehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9 Block 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and flown again.[145]\\n\\nFalcon Heavy is a heavy-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 63,800 kg (140,700 lb) to Low Earth orbit (LEO) or 26,700 kg (58,900 lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines.[146][147] The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on 6 February 2018, launching Musk\\'s personal Tesla Roadster into heliocentric orbit[148]\\n\\nBoth the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL).[149][150] As of 17 December 2024, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 425 times, resulting in 422 full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure before a static fire test in 2016.[151][152]\\n\\nSpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a reusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. As of 2017[update], the system was intended to supersede the company\\'s existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.[153][154]\\n\\nRocket engines\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: SpaceX rocket engines\\n\\nSince the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines – Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor – for use in launch vehicles,[155][156] Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft,[157] and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.[158]\\n\\nMerlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1\\'s first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.[159] Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket\\'s second-stage main engine.[156][160]\\n\\nDraco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the reaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft.[157] The SuperDraco engine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario.[161]\\n\\nRaptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system.[155] Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,[162] and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft).[163]\\n\\nDragon spacecraft\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain articles: Dragon 1 and Dragon 2\\n\\nSpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS).\\n\\nThe first-generation Dragon 1 spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with financial support from NASA under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. After a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract.[37]\\n\\nThe currently operational second-generation Dragon 2 spacecraft conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in 2020.[116] It was developed with financial support from NASA under the Commercial Crew Program program. The cargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract with NASA.[164]\\n\\nIn March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA\\'s planned Lunar Gateway space station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) contract.[165] Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[166]\\n\\nSpaceX designed a spacesuit to be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible depressurization.[167] On 4 May 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed for extravehicular activity, planned to be used for a spacewalk during the Polaris Dawn mission.[168]\\n\\nAutonomous spaceport drone ships\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain articles: SpaceX reusable launch system development program, Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests, and Autonomous spaceport drone ship\\n\\nSpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems.[169] When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).[170]\\n\\nSpaceX also had plans to introduce floating launch platforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a sea launch option for their Starship launch vehicle. As of February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but had not ruled out sea-based platforms for future use.[171]\\n\\nStarlink\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Starlink\\n\\nStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX,[7][172] that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites in ~550 km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities.[173] Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9.[174] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[175] and first orders were taken in early 2021.[176] Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[177] In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide.[178]\\n\\nThe planned large number of Starlink satellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns over light pollution,[179][180][181] with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.[182] In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[183] The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris collisions.[184][185] However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.[186]\\n\\nIn December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer procuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.[187][188]\\n\\nIn June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the \"Starlink Mini\", designed for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for $599 in an early access release, it was more expensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard version, featured a built-in WiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download speeds.[189]\\n\\nOther projects\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Hyperloop pod competition\\n\\nHyperloop\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX\\'s headquarters for the competitive events.[190][191] The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019.[192]\\n\\nCOVID-19 antibody-testing program\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.[193][194]\\n\\nOther\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[195] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk\\'s involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[196][197] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[198][199] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn\\'t practical for the rescue mission.[195]\\n\\nFacilities\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company\\'s operations are based out of its office in Hawthorne, California where it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.\\n\\nThe company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, a rocket development and test facility in McGregor, Texas,[200] and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C. area, close to key government customers.[201]\\n\\nSpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch site at Starbase in Texas.\\n\\nHawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California. The three-story building, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages,[202] houses SpaceX\\'s office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.[203]\\n\\nThe area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and/or subsidiaries in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas main satellite building campuses, The Aerospace Corporation, Raytheon, NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States Space Force\\'s Space Systems Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.[202]\\n\\nSpaceX uses a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[17] SpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.[17]\\n\\nThe Hawthorne facility was SpaceX\\'s headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate SpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain to the company\\'s operations.[204]\\n\\nBoca Chica, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: SpaceX Starbase\\n\\nSpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014.[205][206] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.[207] SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,[208] with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019[203] and orbital launches starting in 2023.\\n\\nSpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental impact of its Starbase facility.[209][210][211] In August 2024, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality cited SpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the Boca Chica launch site.[212] The EPA fined SpaceX approximately $150,000 for allegedly discharging \"industrial wastewater\" and violating the Clean Water Act.[213]\\n\\nMcGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas is a rocket engine test facility. Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions.[214][215] The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during the research and development process.[216] In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery, Dragon spacecraft make a stop at McGregor to have their hazardous hypergolic propellant fuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment.[214]\\n\\nSpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active rocket engine test facility in the world, and said that as of 2024[update], over 7,000 tests had been conducted at the facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test stands.[217] Despite its low-profile compared to the company\\'s other facilities, is a critical part of SpaceX\\'s operations, and company president and COO Gwynne Shotwell maintains her primary office in McGregor.[218][214]\\n\\nOriginally the site of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant during World War II,[216] the facility was later used by Beal Aerospace before being leased by SpaceX in 2003.[219] The company has since expanded it significantly from 256 acres (104 ha) in 2003[216] to 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) by 2015.[217] In July 2021, SpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor. This expansion is expected to significantly increase SpaceX\\'s production capacity, with the goal of producing 800 to 1,000 Raptor engines per year.[220][221]\\n\\nStarlink manufacturing facilities\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s Starlink subsidiary operates over two main facilities. Satellite manufacturing takes place near Seattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place near Austin, Texas.\\n\\nStarlink\\'s satellite development and manufacturing operations campus occupies over 314,000 square feet (29,200 m2) in at least six buildings located in Redmond, Washington, east of Seattle. The first building opened in early 2015,[222] and the company later expanded into five buildings on the Redmond Ridge Corporate Center.[223][224]\\n\\nStarlink opened a user terminal manufacturing facility in Bastrop, Texas, east of Austin in December 2023. In its first nine months of operation, the one-million-square-foot (93,000 m2) facility produced one million user terminals and was on track to become the largest factory for printed circuit boards in the United States.[225]\\n\\nLaunch facilities\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: SpaceX launch facilities\\n\\nSpaceX operates four orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for Falcon rockets, and Starbase near Brownsville, Texas for Starship. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.[226] The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°).[227] Larger inclinations, including SSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba.[228]\\n\\nBefore it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island of the Marshall Islands.[229]\\n\\nIn April 2007, the Pentagon approved the use of Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) by SpaceX.[230] The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. The former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.[231]\\n\\nVandenberg Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles,[232] but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted to Landing Zone 4 in 2015 for booster landings.[233]\\n\\nOn 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.[234] The pad was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. As of 2024[update] it is the only pad that supports Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020.[235] Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022.[236]\\n\\nContracts\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFurther information on SpaceX launches: Falcon 1 § Launches, List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches, and List of Starship launches\\n\\nSpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for U.S. military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over $12 billion under contract.[68]\\n\\nCargo to ISS\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain articles: Commercial Orbital Transportation Services, Commercial Resupply Services, and Gateway Logistics Services\\n\\nIn 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport.[237] Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX $396 million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources.[238] These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone.[239]\\n\\nIn December 2010, with the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.[240] Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private spacecraft.[241]\\n\\nCommercial Resupply Services (CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.[242] SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[243]\\n\\nCRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[244][242][245] The final Dragon 1 mission, SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A second phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft.[246][247] In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway space station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[248]\\n\\nCrewed\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSee also: Commercial Crew Program\\n\\nSpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,[249][250] followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft.[251]\\n\\nIn September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.[252] SpaceX won $2.6 billion to complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[252]\\n\\nSpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May 2015,[253] and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[254] In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario.[255]\\n\\nOn 30 May 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[256] The Crew-1 mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on 16 November 2020, with NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi,[257] all members of the Expedition 64 crew.[258] On 23 April 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.[259] The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on 24 April 2021.[260]\\n\\nSpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for private individuals. The first of these missions, Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched the Crew Dragon Resilience from the Florida Kennedy Space Center\\'s Launch Complex 39A atop a Falcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule into low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later when the Resilience splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission simulations.[261]\\n\\nNational defense\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the company.[262] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to $1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[263] In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on 25 June 2019.[264]\\n\\nThe Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[149] This broke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.[265] In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for $82.7 million.[266] This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[267] SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on 20 June 2020.[268] In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[269]\\n\\nThe U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on 1 May 2017.[270] In February 2019, SpaceX secured a $297 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.[271] In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force awarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for $316 million for one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military\\'s satellite launch requirements over the period.[272]\\n\\nSpaceX also designs and launches custom military satellites for the Space Development Agency as part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit.[273] The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth.[274] Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program,[275] and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race in space.[276][277]\\n\\nIn March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a $1.8 billion contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a swarm in low orbits.[278]\\n\\nIn December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn\\'t give have access to government [279]\\n\\nLaunch market competition and pricing pressure\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Space launch market competition\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[17] Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying the Proton).[280] With a published price of $56.5 million per launch to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.[281] European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX.[282]\\n\\nSpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[283] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half.[284][285]\\n\\nCongressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of \"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA\\'s own independently verified numbers, SpaceX\\'s total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at $390 million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about $4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA\\'s traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[239] In May 2020, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA\\'s investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country.[286]\\n\\nAs of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides additional competition for small satellite launchers.[287]\\n\\nCorporate affairs\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nBusiness trends\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nYear Revenue (billion USD) Valuation (billion USD) Number of employees 2002 ca. 30 [ 288 ] 2003 2004 2005 ca. 90 (Feb.)

Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site. CNBC reported that these executive moves demonstrated \"the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying\".[332][333][334]\\n\\nWorkplace culture\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAccording to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture, similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[335] In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published.[336] The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions.[337] Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual harassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed.[338]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[339] In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning \"Elon\\'s harmful Twitter behavior\".[340] It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX\\'s \"no-asshole\" and \"zero tolerance\" policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some felt pressured to sign the letter.[341]\\n\\nThe company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively and is described as fostering a burnout culture.[342] According to a memo by Blue Origin, a rival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,[343][344][345] SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[342]\\n\\nIn June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter against Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and discrimination.[346][347]\\n\\nIn December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well Musk\\'s alleged drug use.[348] [349]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ \"Delaware Business Search (File # 3500808 – Space Exploration Technologies Corp)\".

His other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of December 2024[update], Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$439.4 billion.[2]\\n\\nA member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Musk was born in Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen\\'s University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor\\'s degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but never enrolled in classes, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired US citizenship, and that October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.\\n\\nIn 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), providing most of the initial financing and assuming the position of the company\\'s chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\\n\\nMusk\\'s actions and expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and endorsing an antisemitic trope; he has since apologized for the latter, but continued endorsing such statements. His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including verification.\\n\\nBy early 2024, Musk became active in American politics as a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, becoming Trump\\'s second-largest individual donor in October 2024. In November 2024, Trump announced that he had chosen Musk along with Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead Trump\\'s planned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory board which will make recommendations on improving government efficiency through measures such as slashing \"excess regulations\" and cutting \"wasteful expenditures\".\\n\\nEarly life and education\\n\\nChildhood and family\\n\\nSee also: Family of Elon Musk\\n\\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa\\'s administrative capital.[3][4] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[5][6] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[7][8][9] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[10][11][12][13] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[9][14] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[15][16][17]\\n\\nThe family was wealthy during Elon\\'s youth.[13] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[13] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\".[18][19] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father\\'s dislike of apartheid.[3]\\n\\nElon\\'s maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[16][20][21][22] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[23]\\n\\nAfter his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[5][10] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[24] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[25] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[26] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying, \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless.\"[26] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed, \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\".[27] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[26][27]\\n\\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy.[12][28] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[29] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[30][31]\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[32] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[33] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa\\'s mandatory military service,[34][35] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,[3] and to ease his path to immigration to the United States.[36] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[37]\\n\\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[38] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[39] In 1990, he entered Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario.[40][41] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995.[42] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university\\'s Wharton School.[43][44][45][46][47][48][excessive citations] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[49]\\n\\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[50][51] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[46][43][52] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[53][34] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[52] In response, Musk claimed he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk claimed he was on a student visa at the time.[54]\\n\\nBusiness career\\n\\nZip2\\n\\nMain article: Zip2\\n\\nExternal videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube\\n\\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed Zip2.[55][56] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[57] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[58] with Musk coding the website every night.[58] Musk and his brother\\'s immigration statuses during this period were described by Musk as a \"gray area\", although Kimbal maintained they were working as illegal immigrants.[59][60] A Washington Post exposé from October 2024 reported Musk worked illegally while building the company, citing an email from Musk submitted as evidence during a 2005 defamation trial and the funding agreement from venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures.[52]\\n\\nEventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[49] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[61] however, Musk\\'s attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[62] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[63][64] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[65]\\n\\nX.com and PayPal\\n\\nMain articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia\\n\\nIn March 1999,[66] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[67] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[68]\\n\\nMusk\\'s friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[66] Although Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[69]\\n\\nIn 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[58][69][70] as the latter\\'s money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com\\'s service.[71] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company\\'s employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[72] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[73][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[75][76]\\n\\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal\\'s largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[77][78] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[79][80] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[81]\\n\\nSpaceX\\n\\nMain article: SpaceX\\n\\nIn early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[82] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell, Adeo Ressi, and future NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin[83] to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[84] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[84] With $100 million of his own money,[85] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company\\'s CEO and chief engineer.[86][87]\\n\\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[88] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, now led by Michael D. Griffin as Administrator.[89][90] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[88] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[91] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[92] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[93]\\n\\nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[94] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[95] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk\\'s personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[96][97]\\n\\nSince 2019,[98] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[99] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[100] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[101]\\n\\nStarlink\\n\\nMain article: Starlink\\n\\nSee also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War\\n\\nIn 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[102] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[103] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[104][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[107][108][109]\\n\\nDuring the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[110] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[111] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[112][113][114] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[115][116]\\n\\nIn September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[117][118][119]\\n\\nTesla\\n\\nMain article: Tesla, Inc.\\n\\nTesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company\\'s early development prior to Musk\\'s involvement.[120] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla\\'s board of directors as chairman.[121][122] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[123]\\n\\nFollowing a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[124][page needed][125] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[126] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[127][128] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[129] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[130]\\n\\nTesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[131] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[132] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[133] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[134] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[135][136] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any type,[137] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[138] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[139] and delivered in November 2023.[140] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[141]\\n\\nSince its initial public offering in 2010,[142] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[143][144] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[145][146] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in US history to do so.[147] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell some of his Tesla stock.[148] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[148] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[149] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[150] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[151] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[152]\\n\\nSEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets\\n\\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[153][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[153][157][158] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\\'s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[159] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[160] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[161] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[162][163]\\n\\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[164] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[165] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[166] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[167][168] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla\\'s solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[169]\\n\\nSolarCity and Tesla Energy\\n\\nMain articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy\\n\\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[170] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[171] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[172] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[173][174]\\n\\nTesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal\\'s announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla\\'s stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[175] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla\\'s directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[176][177] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[178][179] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk\\'s favor.[180]\\n\\nNeuralink\\n\\nMain article: Neuralink\\n\\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[181][182] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[182][183] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer\\'s disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[184]\\n\\nIn 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[181] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink\\'s research,[185] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[186] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[187][188][189] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[187] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[184] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[190]\\n\\nNeuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis\\' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company\\'s animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink\\'s animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[191] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[192] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[193]\\n\\nThe Boring Company\\n\\nMain article: The Boring Company\\n\\nIn 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[194][195] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX\\'s offices, as that required no permits.[196] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[197]\\n\\nTwo tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[198][199] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[200] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[201]\\n\\nTwitter / X\\n\\nFurther information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk\\n\\nAvatar of Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk\\n\\nI made an offer https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar...\\n\\nApril 14, 2022[202]\\n\\nMusk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[203] and had questioned the platform\\'s commitment to freedom of speech.[204][205] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[206] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[207] making him the largest shareholder.[208][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company\\'s 2013 initial public offering.[210] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter\\'s board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[211][212] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter\\'s stock at $54.20 per share.[208][213] In response, Twitter\\'s board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[214] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[215] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[216][217]\\n\\nTesla\\'s stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[218][219] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde\\'s policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[220] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter\\'s daily active users were spam accounts.[221] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[222] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter\\'s board of directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[223] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[224] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[225] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[226]\\n\\nImmediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[226][227] Musk became the CEO instead.[228] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[229][230][231] and laid off a significant portion of the company\\'s staff.[232][233] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[234][235] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[236] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[237][238]\\n\\nIn December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter\\'s moderation of Hunter Biden\\'s laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[239] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[240][241] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[242]\\n\\nIn late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[243][244] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[245]\\n\\nOn November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[246]\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to \\'09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan\".[247] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals\".[248] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[249]\\n\\nLeadership style\\n\\nMusk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[250] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[251] Musk does not make formal business plans.[251] He has forced employees to adopt the company\\'s own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors\\' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX\\'s rocket,[252] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla\\'s internal corporate software.[250][needs update]\\n\\nMusk\\'s handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[253][254][255] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[256] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[257][255] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[255] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla\\'s workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[258] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[259] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024.\\n\\nMusk\\'s leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[250] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding\".[255][260] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[261] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some[quantify] employees resigning in 2017 in consequence.[262]\\n\\nOther activities\\n\\nMusk Foundation\\n\\nMain article: Musk Foundation\\n\\nMusk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[263][264] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[265]\\n\\nAs of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal\\'s nonprofit Big Green.[266] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk\\'s OpenAI,[267] which was a nonprofit at the time.[268] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[269]\\n\\nIn 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[270] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[271]\\n\\nVox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[267] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[266] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla\\'s shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[272] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation\\'s assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[273] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation\\'s funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[274]\\n\\nHyperloop\\n\\nMain articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition\\n\\nIn August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[275] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[276] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[277] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[278] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[279] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[280]\\n\\nIn 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[281] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[282] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[283] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[284]\\n\\nMobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[285][286] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said, \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision.\"[287]\\n\\nOpenAI and xAI\\n\\nFurther information: OpenAI and xAI (company)\\n\\nIn December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[288] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[24] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[289] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI\\'s funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[290]\\n\\nIn 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[291] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[292] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[293]\\n\\nOn July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[294] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[295]\\n\\nOn February 29, 2024, Musk sued OpenAI, its Chief Executive Sam Altman, and its President Greg Brockman. He accused the company of violating its founding agreement by prioritizing profits over AI safety.[296]\\n\\nTham Luang cave rescue and defamation case\\n\\nFurther information: Tham Luang cave rescue\\n\\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[297] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk\\'s involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[298] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[299][300] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn\\'t practical for the rescue mission.[297][301] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[302]\\n\\nSoon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[303] He then deleted the tweets,[303] apologized,[304] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[305] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[306][307]\\n\\nIn September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[308][309][310] In his defense, Musk argued that, \"\\'pedo guy\\' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with \\'creepy old man\\' and is used to insult a person\\'s appearance and demeanor.\"[32] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury ruled that Musk was not liable.[311][312]\\n\\n2018 cannabis incident\\n\\nIn September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[313] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[314] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[315]\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nIn March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[316][317] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[318] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don\\'t Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[319] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[320] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[319]\\n\\nPrivate jet\\n\\nMain articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions\\n\\nMusk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[321][322] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[321][323] Musk\\'s flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[324][325][326] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O\\'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[327] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[328] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[329] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists\\' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[330]\\n\\nCompany towns\\n\\nMain articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas\\n\\nAfter 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[331][332] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by The Wall Street Journal.[333] Musk\\'s then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[333] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company\\'s stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[333] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[334] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[331]\\n\\nWealth\\n\\nMain article: Wealth of Elon Musk\\n\\nMusk was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[335]\\n\\nPersonal actions, views, and social media usage\\n\\nThis article is part of a series on Conservatism in the United States  Schools Compassionate Fiscal Fusion Liberal Libertarian Moderate Movement Neo- Paleo- Postliberal Populist Progressive Social Straussian Traditionalist Principles American exceptionalism American nationalism Anti-communism Christian nationalism Civil religion Classical liberalism Communitarianism Constitutionalism Culture of life Pro-life Familialism Family values Federalism States\\' rights Gender essentialism Complementarianism Judeo-Christian values Individualism Law and order Limited government Meritocracy Natural aristocracy Militarism Peace through strength Moral absolutism Natural law Ordered liberty Patriotism Property rights Republicanism Right to bear arms Rule of law Supply-side economics Tradition History Loyalists Southern chivalry Solid South New Humanism Southern Agrarians Old Right Conservative Manifesto Conservative coalition America First Committee McCarthyism United States in the 1950s Goldwater campaign New Right Reagan era Reagan Doctrine Reaganomics Neo- vs. paleoconservatism Redeemers Republican Revolution Tea Party movement Trump era First term Second term Intellectuals Adams Anton Babbitt Bacevich Bell Bellow Berger Bloom Boorstin Bradford Buckley Burgess Burnham Calhoun Carl Chambers Conquest Deneen Eastman Eliot Francis Genovese Gottfried Hanson Hazony Himmelfarb Hoppe Hurston Jaffa Kendall Kimball Kirk Kirkpatrick Kreeft Kristol Kuehnelt-Leddihn Lasch Lind Lovecraft Loury Lukacs Mansfield Mencken Meyer Molnar Murray Nisbet Pangle Ransom Rieff Santayana Schaeffer Sowell Strauss Viereck Voegelin Weaver Weyl Wolfe Politicians Abbott Adams (John) Adams (John Quincy) Bolton Buchanan Pat Buchanan J.

Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[336][337] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[338] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[339] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[340] Musk\\'s statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[341][342] and comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[343]\\n\\nThe New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[344] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia\\'s apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[345] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[346][347]\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nMusk said that the US government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[348][349] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[350]\\n\\nTesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[351] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[352] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla\\'s battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[353]\\n\\nMusk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[354][355] Wired magazine speculated that Musk\\'s opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[356] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[357][358]\\n\\nIn December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[359] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[360]\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nMusk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[361] Given the influence of Musk\\'s tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[362] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[363] Musk\\'s social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla\\'s 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk\\'s social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[364] Tesla\\'s announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[365][366]\\n\\nDespite The Boring Company\\'s involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[367][368][369] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[368][370][369]\\n\\nExistential threats\\n\\nMusk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[371] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[372][373] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[374][375] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[376] Musk\\'s AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[377][378] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[379]\\n\\nMusk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[380] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[381] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump\\'s stance on climate change,[382][383] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump\\'s 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[384] In 2021, Musk donated $100 million to fund a competition for new carbon removal ideas.[385] However, Musk\\'s lifestyle has been criticized for high greenhouse gas emissions,[386] and SpaceX has been found violating environmental regulations by repeatedly polluting waters in Texas.[387][388] In an interview with Trump in August 2024, in the lead-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Musk tried to educate Trump on climate change,[389] supporting solar and nuclear energy,[390] but chose not to challenge Trump\\'s dismissive remarks on the issue.[391][392] In the same interview, Musk stated that the economy would collapse without oil and gas, repeating previous statements that it was wrong to \"vilify\" the oil and gas industries.[390][393][394][395]\\n\\nMusk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[396] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[397][398] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[399] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[400][401] saying that, \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[402] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal\\'s CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[403] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[404] He denied the claim.[405]\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nBy early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.[406] By October 2024, he was Trump\\'s second-largest individual 2024 presidential campaign donor.[407] Musk\\'s views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[408][409][410][411][412] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[413] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[414][415][416] and numerous conspiracy theories.[417][418] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[419]\\n\\nMusk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans.[420] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[421] Beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[422]\\n\\nMusk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.[423] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[424] He also endorsed Kanye West\\'s 2020 presidential campaign.[425] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 US presidential election.[426] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[427][428] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 US elections.[429][430] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[431] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 US presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[431] and hosted DeSantis\\'s campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[432][433][434] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[435]\\n\\nAfter the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[436][437] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\\'s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[438] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[438] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[439] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk\\'s help to eliminate the Department of Education.[439] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[440] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[441] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[442] A November 2024 USA Today investigation described how Musk was \"sharing and posting demonstrably false anti-Harris disinformation to his 200 million followers\" on X and promoting conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats and election fraud.[443] Musk has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration.[444][445] After becoming president-elect, Trump announced that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would advise a new Department of Government Efficiency.[446]\\n\\nMusk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[447] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[448][449] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[450] and Elizabeth Warren.[451] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don\\'t shoot\" was made up.[452][453] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[454] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[455] Musk repeatedly used his platform on X to promote the claim that Democrats had been \"importing\" immigrants to vote for them. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger requested that X remove a fabricated video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant who had voted multiple times. Musk complied, but the video had already gone viral.[456]\\n\\nConservative PAC activities\\n\\nIn July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[457] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[458] In October 2024, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump\\'s campaign.[459][460]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Musk promoted a sweepstakes conducted by his America PAC, offering to pay $1 million per day to randomly selected registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition pledging support of the First and Second Amendments. Within days the U.S. Justice Department wrote America PAC warning that the sweepstakes might be illegal. Compensating people to register to vote violates federal law, and although registering to vote was not a condition to signing the petition, some legal analysts said the sweepstakes might induce people to register in order to participate. Musk\\'s defenders said signing the petition did not specifically induce people to register, although he had previously said registering voters was one of his goals in Pennsylvania and had begun describing prize winners as America PAC \"spokespeople\".[461][462] After receiving the Justice Department\\'s warning, Musk awarded two people $1 million each.[463] On October 28, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, sued Musk and America PAC.[464] Although Musk had originally said that the prize would be \"randomly\" awarded, his lawyer argued that recipients \"earn\" the money after being \"selected based on their suitability to serve as spokesperson for America PAC\". After an all-day hearing on November 4, the day before Election Day, the judge ruled that Musk could continue his daily giveaway.[465]\\n\\nMusk provided over $50 million in 2022 to fund Citizens for Sanity, a group created by former Trump senior advisor Steven Miller to finance $93 million in advertisements related to culture war issues. The New York Times and OpenSecrets reported in October 2024 that some of Musk\\'s donations were routed through Building America\\'s Future, a hub of a dark money network supporting Trump. Building America\\'s Future created \"Progress 2028\", presented as the left\\'s response to Project 2025, that promoted misinformation about the agenda of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Musk has promoted the Fair Election Fund, which is heavily funded by Building America\\'s Future, and offers rewards for evidence of election fraud. That group is heavily involved in America PAC, founded and funded exclusively by Musk.[466][467][468][469]\\n\\nIn October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America\\'s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[470][471]\\n\\nInternational politics\\n\\nMusk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[472] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[473]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[474][475] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[476][477][478]\\n\\nIn October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[479][480] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian president Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[481][482][483] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[484][485][486][487]\\n\\nIn a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel\\'s retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel\". He added that, \"if you kill somebody\\'s child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[488] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea\", or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[489] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel where he toured with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the kibbutz Kfar Aza, site of one of the worst atrocities during the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. He described the experience as \"jarring\".[490]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying, \"Shouldn\\'t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\".[491] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable.\" His comments were condemned by Starmer\\'s official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson\\'s account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter\\'s previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[492][493][494][495] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren\\'t all communities protected in Britain?\".[496][497] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainment camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[498][499] In November 2024, he wrote that Britain was \"going full Stalin\" following the Labour government\\'s decision to end the inheritance tax exemption on agricultural assets worth more than £1 million.[500] In December 2024, it was reported that Musk was planning to donate $100 million to Nigel Farage\\'s Reform UK party ahead of the next UK election, aiming to help Farage become Prime Minister. It was suggested that Musk could route the funds through X\\'s UK branch to bypass donation laws.[501]\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October 2024 that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin, Sergey Kiriyenko, and other high ranking Russian government officials since late 2022, discussing personal topics, business and geopolitical matters. The Kremlin denied the report, stating Musk and Putin had spoken only once.[502][503] The Journal reported that in one instance Putin had asked Musk to avoid activating his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan, to appease Chinese president Xi Jinping, according to a former Russian intelligence officer briefed on the situation.[504] Bloomberg and others had also previously reported in July 2023 that communications between Taiwan and SpaceX had broken down over the ownership of Starlink\\'s subsidiary in the country.[505][506] The communications with Putin were reported to be a closely held secret in government, given Musk\\'s involvement in promoting the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump. One person said no alerts were raised by the US government, noting the dilemma of the government being dependent on Musk\\'s technologies.[504] Democrat lawmakers and NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that it should be investigated to find out if the report was accurate. \"We should investigate what Elon Musk is up to to make sure that it is not to the detriment of the national security of the United States\", elaborated Representative Adam Smith.[507] SpaceX officially responded via their X account stating, \"Starlink is not available [in Taiwan] because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate, and regulators declined to remove a requirement that a foreign entity own 51% of Starlink to operate there. SpaceX has not accepted such a condition for any market in which it operates.\"[508]\\n\\nGovernment advisory roles\\n\\nUS president-elect Donald Trump announced on November 12, 2024 that Musk would become an inaugural leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a governmental advisory body that will \"slash excess regulations [and] cut wasteful expenditures\". Vivek Ramaswamy would be tasked with leading the department alongside Musk.[509][510]\\n\\nAccusations of antisemitism\\n\\nThe Israeli government and several media outlets have accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[511] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[512]\\n\\nOn November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting \\'Hitler was right\\': You got something you want to say? Why don\\'t you say it to our faces.\"[513][514] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I\\'m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don\\'t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied, \"You have said the actual truth.\"[513][514] Musk further clarified that he doesn\\'t believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[515] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL.\"[516]\\n\\nThe first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[517] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites\".[518][519] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[520][521] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[522]\\n\\nAt the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk\\'s recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don\\'t advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying, \"Hey Bob, if you\\'re in the audience.\"[523][524] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying, \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[525] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I\\'ve done\".[526][527]\\n\\nIn January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[528] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[529] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour\".[530]\\n\\nCOVID-19\\n\\nMusk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[531][532] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[533]\\n\\nIn March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[534][535] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the US population.[531] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero\" new cases in the US by end of April.[532] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[536] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[537][538]\\n\\nMusk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[531][539][540] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[541][542] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[542] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[543][544]\\n\\nIn March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[545] After figures such as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk\\'s offer,[546] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[545] However, Musk ultimately purchased and donated BiPAP and CPAP machines rather than ventilators.[547][548]\\n\\nIn September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[549][550] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[551] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[551][552] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[553]\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nMusk became a US citizen in 2002.[554] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[555] He then relocated to Boca Chica, Texas,[556][557] saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[555][558][559] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[560][561]\\n\\nMusk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[562] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[563][564] Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he uses it \"once every other week\",[565] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[566][567][568]\\n\\nRelationships and children\\n\\nMusk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[1] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen\\'s University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[569] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[570] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[571] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[571] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[572][573]\\n\\nIn 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[574] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother\\'s surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[574] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[575][576] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson\\'s podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son, essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it\\'s called deadnaming is because your son is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[577] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; saying that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic\", whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[578] On November 7, 2024, in response to a news article about his daughter\\'s reaction to Trump\\'s win, Elon Musk wrote \"the woke mind virus killed my son.\"[579]\\n\\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[580] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[581][582] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[583] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[583] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[584] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[585] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[586]\\n\\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[587] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[588][589] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[590][591] which they then changed to \"X Æ A-Xii\".[592][593] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[594]\\n\\nIn December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[595] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[596][597] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we\\'re very fluid.\"[595] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[598] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[599] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[600][601][602]\\n\\nIn July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[603] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[604] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[605][1] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[606] Musk denied the report.[607] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend\".[608] In October 2024, The New York Times reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and the mothers of his children.[609]\\n\\nLegal matters after 2020\\n\\nFurther information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\\n\\nIn May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[610] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.\" He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[611][612] After the release of the article, Tesla\\'s stock fell by more than 6%,[613] and Barron\\'s wrote, \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[614]\\n\\nIn April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein\\'s sex trafficking operation.[615] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[615]\\n\\nMusk\\'s former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[616][617] On July 27, 2024, Grimes\\' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[618]\\n\\nBen Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[619][620][621] According to Brody\\'s complaint, one of Musk\\'s X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody\\'s alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a \\'false flag\\' operation to deceive the American public\".[619] The complaint also alleged that Musk\\'s accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[619][620][622] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[623] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[624][625]\\n\\nIn October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[626][627][628] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[626][628] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[629]\\n\\nIn January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk\\'s $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[630] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company\\'s board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[631] A re-ratification shareholders\\' vote passed in mid-June 2024, although much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[632]\\n\\nIn June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern\\'s lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies\".[633] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[634]\\n\\nAlso in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[635]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[636][637][638] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged \"acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[639]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Musk and his America PAC were sued in Pennsylvania for allegedly operating an unlawful lottery before the 2024 US presidential election.[640] Musk\\'s lawyer argued the giveaway wasn\\'t a lottery since the recipients weren\\'t chosen by chance, leading one prosecuting attorney to call the effort a \"scam\" designed to influence the election.[641] in November 2024, he was sued again regarding the lottery[642] and two US senators called for a probe into alleged contacts with Putin.[643]\\n\\nPublic perception\\n\\nFurther information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk\\n\\nAlthough his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk\\'s actions and his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure.[644] Biographer Ashlee Vance described people\\'s opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[645]\\n\\nMusk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[646] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film\\'s 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[647] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[648] Why Him? (2016),[649] and Men in Black: International (2019).[650] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[651] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[652] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[653][654] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[655] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo\\'s Morty\", 2019),[656][657] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[658] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[659][660]\\n\\nAwards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[661] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[662] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[663] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[664] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[665] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[666]\\n\\nTime has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[667] 2013,[668] 2018,[669] and 2021.[670] Musk was selected as Time\\'s \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that, \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too.\"[671][672]\\n\\nIn February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[673]\\n\\nIn 2024, Musk’s Royal Society membership was criticized by 74 members over his alleged anti-scientific behavior and promotion of misinformation, prompting debates about the society’s standards on membership and leading to Dorothy Bishop, a renowned neuropsychologist at University of Oxford, to resign over her dissatisfaction with the Society\\'s response.[674]\\n\\nMusk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy.[675] His influence in the second presidency of Donald Trump led some to call him the \"actual president-elect\", \"shadow president\" or \"co-president\".[676][677]\\n\\nNotes and references\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[74][75]\\n\\n^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[105][106]\\n\\n^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[154] Members of Tesla\\'s board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[155][156]\\n\\n^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of US securities laws.[209]\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n^ a b c Alexander, Sophie; Hull, Dana (June 21, 2024). \"Elon Wants YOU to Have More Babies\".

              "'Tell me the summary of the book Zero to One by Peter Thiel.\\nMBA or No MBA? That is the question. In his book, Zero to One, Peter Thiel explores the age of unrestricted innovation, and discusses how entrepreneurs can leverage technology and resources to transform markets and change the world.\\nThe book is rooted in the idea that the only way to truly create value is to find new ways of doing things, rather than simply optimizing existing ones. Thiel, a renowned venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal, argues that creating something truly new is not only possible but necessary in today’s rapidly changing world.\\nThiel offers practical advice on how to create a successful business, including his famous concept of the “Competition Formula,” which suggests that the best way to compete is not to offer something better, but to create something new. According to Thiel, the most successful businesses are those that invent new markets, rather than simply trying to optimize existing ones.\\nOne of the most important takeaways from the book is the distinction between “ zero to one” and “one to zero.” The former refers to creating something completely new, while the latter refers to simply copying an existing idea or product. Thiel emphasizes the importance of aiming for “zero to one” in order to truly create value and drive innovation.\\nAnother key concept in the book is the idea of the“secret sauce.” This refers to the unique combination of ingredients that make a business successful. Thiel argues that understanding the secret sauce of a particular market or industry is essential to creating value and achieving success.\\nFinally, Thiel explores the intersection of technology and society, discussing how technological advancements are transforming the way businesses operate and how society functions as a whole. He argues that entrepreneurs have a responsibility to use technology to improve the world and create value, rather than simply to make money.\\nOverall, Zero to One offers a compelling and insightful look at the art of entrepreneurship and the importance of creating something new in today’s rapidly changing world. Through his practical advice and thought-provoking ideas, Thiel shows readers how to drive innovation and create value in a variety of industries and markets.'"

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\\n\\nSpace Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to as SpaceX, is an American space technology company headquartered at the Starbase development site near Brownsville, Texas. Since its founding in 2001, the company has made numerous advancements in rocket propulsion, reusable launch vehicle, human spaceflight and satellite constellation technology. As of 2024[update], SpaceX is the world's dominant space launch provider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like the Chinese space program.[8] SpaceX, NASA, and the United States Armed Forces work closely together by means of governmental contracts.[9]\\n\\nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[94] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[95] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[96][97]\\nSince 2019,[98] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[99] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[100] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[101]\\nStarlink\\nMain article: Starlink\\nSee also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War\\n\\nSpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2001 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way to a sustainable colony on Mars. In 2008, when SpaceX was almost bankrupt, Falcon 1 successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then pivoted towards the development of the larger Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon 1 capsule to satisfy NASA's COTS contracts for deliveries to the International Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began delivering Commercial Resupply Services missions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make the Falcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated the first successful first-stage landing in 2015 and re-launch of the first stage in 2017. Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters, first flew in 2018 after a more than decade-long development process. As of October 2024, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown again more than 330 times, reaching 1–2 launches a week.\\n\\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[88] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, now led by Michael D. Griffin as Administrator.[89][90] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[88] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[91] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[92] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[93]\\n\\nQuestion: What is is the work of Spacex\\nHelpful Answer:\\nSpaceX is a private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company that aims to reduce space transportation costs and enable the colonization of Mars. Its primary work involves designing, developing, and launching rockets and spacecraft, such as the Falcon 9 and Dragon, for satellite constellation technology, human spaceflight, and reusable rocket propulsion. SpaceX also works closely with government agencies like NASA and the United States Armed Forces on various contracts and projects.\""

This allows Llama 2 to distinguish relationships between concepts, like understanding that \"Apple\" and \"iPhone\" are closely related but distinct from \"apple,\" \"banana,\" and \"fruit.\" Overall, Llama 2 is an impressive example of the potential of AI research and its ability to improve the lives of individuals and organizations. \n",
